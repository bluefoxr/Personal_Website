I would primarily describe myself as a data scientist but I have a very broad background. I'm eternally curious about learning new things, and this has led me to work in all kinds of fields. Following my PhD in Mechanical Engineering in the UK, I moved to Italy to work on scientific research for policy making. I have become internationally-recognised expert in both of the main fields I have worked in in recent years: sensitivity/uncertainty analysis, and composite indicators. I've worked on high-impact projects with dozens of international organisations, and in the meantime racked up around 30 journal publications, with 1200+ citations and counting.

Throughout my career I've discovered what I really enjoy:

* Working with interesting people
* Tackling challenging problems
* The satisfaction of doing something well
* Learning new things and teaching others

To find out more about my work, see my recent projects. For my research, see my publications list.
