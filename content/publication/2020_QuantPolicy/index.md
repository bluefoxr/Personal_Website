abstract: This Chapter presents a set of quantitative modelling approaches, connected to various steps of the policy cycle, that aim at helping policy-makers and all social actors involved, by providing a scientific sound framework for a systematic, coherent and transparent analysis. Practical guidelines for structuring policy problems by using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, multi-criteria decision analysis, composite indicators and ex-post impact evaluation are provided.
