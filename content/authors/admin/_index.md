I'm a versatile and innovative data scientist with a broad background. I have a PhD in mechanical engineering (uncertainty analysis and machine learning) and 11+ years of experience leading data-driven projects in fields ranging from sustainable development, engineering and public policy to econometrics and globalisation.

I'm a very experienced statistical programmer and developer (R, Matlab, Python), but also an excellent communicator, distilling complex analysis into key messages for policy and business. In parallel I have a strong academic reputation with 1200+ citations and approx 30 papers in the fields of sensitivity analysis, machine learning and indicator analysis in particular. 

I love working with other people, challenging myself and learning new things, as well as sharing my knowledge and experience with others.
