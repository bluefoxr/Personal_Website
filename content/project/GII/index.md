Over 2021-2022 I have developed a custom R package for the UN's [World Intellectual Property Organisation](https://www.wipo.int/portal/en/index.html). This involved building a streamlined package capable of building the [Global Innovation Index](https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/Home) (a hierarchical composite indicator), including data screening, data treatment, normalisation and aggregation.

The package also allows ex-post checks on methodological assumptions, and automatically yields data for generating country profiles. This greatly saves time and dramatically reduces the possibility of errors in the complex model evaluation.

The package is hosted at a private repo on Github.
