I have been an enthusiastic teacher and trainer for many years. This includes:

* Leading and organising stats/data training courses for the European Commission
* Training researchers and colleagues on [composite indicators](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/navigation-page/jrc-week-composite-indicators-scoreboards_en)
* Training researchers and colleagues on sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (see [here](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/event/eleventh-summer-school-sensitivity-analysis-model-output-samo-2022_en) and earlier editions)
* Private tuition on statistical programming, data analysis and indicators
